A video rental web application for entering the customers details, membership type and rented movies. It also includes different types of user login roles for the store managers, store staffs and guest users. Store managers have full privileges to Add, Edit and Delete customers and movies, while store staff could only add rented movies for the customer and the guest users have read only privilege. Customers or guest users can register via facebook profile by using one click facebook button registration for easy use.
For better application speed performance, I implemented client-side validation, Web API and Ajax to get data from the server and post data to the server.
